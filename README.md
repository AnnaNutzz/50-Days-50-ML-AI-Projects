# 50 Days 50 AI Projects

This repository is my personal AI/ML mastery challenge.  
Over 50 days, I am building 50 machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, generative AI, optimization, and agent-based projects.

This repo also doubles as my **AI notes hub**, containing structured explanations of algorithms, mathematics, and concepts I study along the way.

The goal:  
To build a complete, practical, industry-ready AI portfolio and create a single place that documents both my **projects** and **learning journey**.

## Objectives

- Build 50 hands-on AI/ML projects  
- Maintain detailed AI/ML notes across all major domains  
- Strengthen understanding of algorithms, architectures, and training workflows  
- Practice clean engineering pipelines and reproducible experiments  
- Create a strong public AI portfolio for future roles and research work

# Notes Section

This repository includes a complete ML/AI notes library that I update daily.

```
