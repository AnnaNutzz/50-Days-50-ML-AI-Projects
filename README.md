# 50 Days 50 AI Projects

This repository documents my personal **AI/ML mastery challenge**.  
Over 50 days, I’m building **50 progressive AI projects** covering:

- Classical Machine Learning  
- Neural Networks & Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Natural Language Processing  
- Generative AI  
- MLOps  
- Agents & Full AI Systems  

This repo also doubles as my **AI notes vault**, where I store structured explanations, math, algorithms, and architecture breakdowns as I learn.
